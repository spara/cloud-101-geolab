    "## Seismic Data: FDSNWS\n",
    "The fdsnws-station web service returns station metadata in FDSN StationXML format v1.1 (schema here) or as delimited text. Results are available at multiple levels of granularity: network, station, channel and response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata may be selected based on channel descriptors, time ranges, geographic regions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This service is an implementation of the FDSN web service specification version 1.1.\n",

    "## Accessing Web Services\n",
    "Web services can be accessed in a number of different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Small requests can be handled through your browser.\n",
    "Dedicated clients are available for making more complex or larger queries.\n",
    "Automated or scripted requests can be made using programs such as wget or curl.\n",
    "A Java API is available for Java and MATLAB users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP GET\n",
    "via HTTP GET: Provide a series of parameter-value pairs in the URL that specify the start-time and end-time, along with the desired network(s), station(s), location(s) and channel(s). Please refer to the table below titled “Detailed Descriptions of each Query Parameter” for usage details. Each parameter-value pair should be separated by an ampersand &, and with no space. A GET request may take the following general form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/query? [channel-options] [time-constraints] [geographic-constraints] [miscellaneous] [nodata=404]\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "### HTTP POST\n",
    "\n",
    "via HTTP POST: Submit an arbitrary selection list to the service. Please note that all parameters listed under the rectangular geographic constraints, radial geographic constraints, and miscellaneous sections of the Detailed Descriptions of each Query Parameter table on the main service documentation page may be submitted using either GET or POST methods. For additional details on constructing and submitting POST selection files, visit the POST Examples in the Help section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requests submitted via HTTP POST allow for arbitrary combinations of network, station, location, channel and time window. All of the parameters that can be submitted with the GET method are allowed in POST with the following exceptions: startbefore, endbefore, startafter, endafter. The general form of a POST request is parameter=value pairs, one per line, followed by an arbitrary number of channel and time window selection lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Often such a POST request is created as a file and then an HTTP tool is used to submit the file to the service. The text of an example selection in a file named station.request could look like:\n",

    "```\n",
    "$ cat station.request\n",
