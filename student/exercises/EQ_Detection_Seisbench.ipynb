    "In recent years, seismology has significantly benefited from machine learning (ML), which enhances efficiency, accuracy, and scope in earthquake detection. ML automates vast data processing, reducing manual effort and enabling real-time monitoring. It improves detection accuracy by recognizing patterns and anomalies often missed by traditional methods. ML models are adaptable and scalable, suitable for various regions and capable of analyzing global seismic data simultaneously. This notebook demonstrates the integration of Seisbench a common package used for ML studies, into an earthquake detection workflow.\n",

    "# 2. Phase Picking with PhaseNet (Seisbench) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **PhaseNet** with **Seisbench** for phase picking significantly enhances earthquake detection by leveraging machine learning for precise seismic data analysis. PhaseNet, a pre-trained model available in Seisbench, automates the classification of seismic phases (P and S waves), which is crucial for accurate earthquake detection and analysis. The code demonstrates a workflow for using PhaseNet to classify seismic phases within a specified time window, utilizing parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code begins by setting up necessary imports and initializing the PhaseNet model. It defines a period of interest and extracts a list of stations from the inventory. A function **fetch_waveform_data** is created to fetch waveform data for a given station within a specified time window. The central processing loop iterates through each time window, fetching and combining waveform data from multiple stations concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor. This parallel processing approach significantly speeds up data retrieval, using multiple CPU cores to handle the high volume of seismic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the waveform data is retrieved, PhaseNet classifies the data to identify P and S wave picks. These picks are then added to a catalog, which is later fed into the associator for further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: This process can take up to 10 minutes or more to identify P and S wave picks for each waveform and may take serveral hours to complete using this data."

    "PyOcto is a high-throughput seismic phase associator that efficiently links seismic phases to specific earthquake events, accurately determining their locations and origin times. It utilizes a 4D space-time partitioning method, starting with a large node that spans the entire study area and iteratively refines potential earthquake locations by splitting nodes based on the highest number of picks. This process is managed using a priority queue system, enhancing processing speed by discarding non-promising nodes early. PyOcto supports homogeneous and 1D velocity models and allows for customizable parameters for multi-region studies. \n",
